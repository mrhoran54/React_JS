So my task for this project was to make a clone of  http://itsthisforthat.com.

First things first who to run this on your machine. Here are the few easy steps:

1. extract the files
2. run requirments.txt to get all the right versions and things for this project
3. First get mongo going: in the root directory of the project run 'sudo mongod' or just 'mongod'
4. Now time to get the server up and running for our locally hosted api. cd into the api folder and then run 'npm run dev'
5. Now finally time to boot up the website: go into the my-app/src/ folder and enter 'npm start'
6. Now go to http://localhost:3000/ to check it out.

I'm breaking up my process into two parts:

1. website

So first of all I knew I wanted to use React because it was something I had been meaning to learn and builds on my exisisting java script knowledge. That meant I had to go into the React docs, which were incredibly helpful, and learn the basics from there. I then messed around with their tic tac toe game to get used to state and the various syntax nuances. on my first rendition of the app, I used hard coded the this and that arrays from the origical website to make sure my website was rendering the information and it all looked good with my nex JCX knowledge. It looks good. Now time to deal with the API.

**One note: I changed the functionality slightly so that you can change just the 'this' or just the 'that' value: I thought it was more fun to make it customizable if you found a funny phrase and wanted to cycle through the other values to get the best pairing.

2. API

At first I just used their api http://itsthisforthat.com/api.php?json. From there I immediately was stumped by the fact that I couldn't just ingest all the this that pairings from the API at once and store that into the array. I thought alot about all the different ways that I could just iterate over all the pairings, checking to see if I had added them into the array, and putting them all into an array. I wanted to make it as efficient as possible, eliminating extraneous api calls. But it didn't make sense. So I would just call the API on the onclick function to generate the new pairing. At first I had to deal with the whole concept of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) with the no 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header provided error. One way to deal with that is using a proxy server, such as  https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ . This made my website render slowly. So the I decided to just write my own API. That way I could set my own headers and not worry about the proxy server. And there you have it: *the process*
